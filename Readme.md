# Unnamed Photo Project ðŸ“¸
This repo is a react-native app ([expo](https://expo.dev)), which I've spent the last couple months building. It started in April 2023 and have not been able to work on this project every week.

I restarted the project (which is now this repo) because the I wasn't really proud of my first version. It contained small annoying bugs, and didn't really look all that good. I've now learned from my mistakes since my first try making this app.

### What is this app used for?
This app is used for fun. You take a couple pictures a week of your face and the app auto-aligns every selfie ontop of eachother so that it can be stitched together and look like a smooth timelapse of your face.

### What are my plans?
I've really not decided yet wether I'd want to publish this app or not, but this could probably be a good addition to my project portfolio.
